# Making pasta

## Intro

A year or so back, I bought a pasta maker for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. It was only part of my gift to her, but being in the 'cooking' stage of our relationship, I thought it made for a properly thought out gift. As time went on and our lives became increasingly more busy, we slowly stopped using the pasta maker, and opted for faster, more convenient options for starch (we like rice) leaving our pasta maker untouched for weeks at a time.

This past weekend, inspired by a MasterChef episode and feeling bad for my untouched pasta maker, I decided to attempt a different type of pasta, fettuchine's wider cousin, [pappardelle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/06IDdD75jqA). 

## Making the Dough

I began by making the dough, just as I always have. For every one egg (depending on size), slowly add around 4/5ths of a cup of flour. When the dough is just coming together, I knead until I lose patience. Kneading the slighlty wet dough, works air into the dough, and develops gluten, making the dough more elastic over time. While it might seem like the dough may need more flour, by adding too much flour too early, you risk over flouring the dough, rendering it extremely difficult (pretty much impossible) to manage. 

If I wanted to make a slightly richer, more golden color of a dough, I would replace the one egg for ~3 egg yolks, removing the whites. 

Once the dough is complete, I wrap it in saran wrap, and put it in my refigerator for somewhere near 45 minutes. 

## Making the Pasta 

Once the 45 minutes are up, I portion my dough into smaller, more manageable pieces, and begin to roll them out in my pasta maker. Starting at the widest setting, I slowly increase the number of the rolling machine, flattening the pasta sheet over time. As I continue to roll the pasta sheet out, I will add flour to my sheet so that it doesn't stick to my pasta maker, the counter, or to itself. While holding the pasta, I always use the backs of my hands in order to maintain the structure of the sheet as to not accidentally rip a hole in it. 

Once I have my very long pasta sheet, I lightly flour the counter top that I'll be using, lightly flour both sides of my sheet of pasta, and roll it up from both side towards the center. Then, using a bench scraper, I cut them up, unfold, and I have my pasta sheets. 

If this made no sense, see the video linked above. 

## Multitasking

It is at this point where you'll need to do multiple things at once. The only two things that need to be kept track of are 

1. The pasta
2. The sace

Fresh pasta cooks extraordinarily fast, no more than two minutes (especially if it's being finished in sauce).

Knowing this, it might be ideal to start the sauce (maybe takes 5 minutes), then throw in the pasta, then finish the sauce, then take out the pasta. This is unfortunately concurrent programming, there's only one cpu, only one you. 

Carefully place the pasta noodles into a pot of softly boiling salted water until either a minute and a half, or until they begin floating. Overcooked pasta will become rubbery and elastic as opposed to slightly chewy, and will lose it's ability to grip onto the sauce it's placed in, regardless of how emulsified it may be.

## Making the Sauce

Now that I am making my pasta, the most time consuming part of this process is done. In order to make my sauce, I will start with either butter, or rendered out leftover bacon / guanciale / pancetta fat, and add in some minced garlic to a medium heat skillet or frying pan. I then salt my ingredients in the pan, because although the cheese at the end adds a lot of salt, I find it to usually be not enough for me. Then, I usually add in cracked black (or white) pepper to bloom that spice immediately. 

I quickly afterwards add in heavy cream and let that come to a light boil in order to reduce itself. By stirring occasionally, you can knock it off of the boil if needed. 

I then add nutmeg, and begin slowly adding in my parmigiano reggiano to the sauce. Stirring and adding in small portions at a time prevents cheese clumps forming within the sauce.

The sauce should be on the thicker side because we'll be adding our pasta noodles to it later (which will have some water to thin the overall mixture).

## Putting it all Together

Now that we have both our pasta and the sauce (hopefully correctly timed), it's now time to begin adding both togther in order to create our final dish. 
Simply pull out the drained noodles from your water with a spider, and add it to the sauce. The thick sauce should thin from the excess water from the noodles. This emulsification process is important. 

Emulsifying in this case, is the process of rapdily mixing the water from the pasta into the thick sauce that we created before. 

Overcrowding your pan will make this process a lot more difficult than it needs to be. 

Mix the noodels in the sauce until well coated and if you leave it on a medium - low heat for only a little while longer, your dish is ready to be plated and eaten. 

If the heat is too high, this will highly increase the chances of breaking your sauce. Leave the pan on a relatively low heat. Continuously move the pasta around in order to emulsify the butter cheese mixture and the water. A great example of a proper emulsification can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v50OQFhc16U). 

**NOTE** if the sauce is too thick, add water. If the pasta is thin, leave it on the heat to reduce. 

**IF** you continuously add water to the sauce, althoguh you are thinning it out, you are also simultaneously watering the flavors of your sauce. This is not good, but will only take serious effect further down the road.

## Eating

Now, eat. The reason that I chose pappardelle for this recipie as opposed to fetuccine is because I enjoy unraveling the large noodles and eating them almost one by one, covered in sauce for this dish as opposed to maybe eating parts of some noodles, and parts of others in a single bite. 

I usually pair my dish with a glass of water, because I know nothing about wines yet.
