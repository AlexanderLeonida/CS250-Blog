As I continue the process of solidifying into my full 'adult' form, I am finding myself increasingly interested in the  prospect of differing persepectives, opinions, and characterstic backgrounds. I have a long history of delving as deep as possible into one on one conversations with unfamiliar faces; some of which I would consider "pretty interesting". Sitting down in front of another person to translate their words, emotions, and unspoken thoughts into my own mind is life-giving, but the real magic happens when I decend into my own mind where emulsion, squeeges and puzzle pieces come together as tools of what it means to be a 'good person'. 

Today I had the privilege of meeting an extraordinarily unique human being, Jenna (a real person, with a fictitious name for anonymity). Traversing our every day world without the sense of sight, Jenna and I spoke for the first time, briefly, about the importance of AI in her every day life. 

The first challenge in Jenna's homework process is logging into her own school account in order to access the work that needs to be done.
