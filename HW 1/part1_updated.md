# Making pasta

A year or so back, I bought a pasta maker for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. It was only part of my gift to her, but being in the 'cooking' stage of our relationship, I thought it made for a properly thought out gift. As time went on and our lives became increasingly more busy, we slowly stopped using the pasta maker, and opted for faster, more convenient options for starch (we like rice) leaving our pasta maker untouched for weeks at a time.

This past weekend, inspired by a MasterChef episode and feeling bad for my untouched pasta maker, I decided to attempt a different type of pasta, fettuchine's wider cousin, [pappardelle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/06IDdD75jqA). 

I began by making the dough, just as I always have. For every one egg (depending on size), slowly add around 4/5ths of a cup of flour. When the dough is just coming together, I knead until I lose patience. Kneading the slighlty wet dough, works air into the dough, and develops gluten, making the dough more elastic over time. While it might seem like the dough may need more flour, by adding too much flour too early, you risk over flouring the dough, rendering it extremely difficult (pretty much impossible) to manage. 

Once the dough is complete, I wrap it in saran wrap, and put it in my refigerator for somewhere near 45 minutes.
