# Making pasta

A year or so back, I bought a pasta maker for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. It was only part of my gift to her, but being in the 'cooking' stage of our relationship, I thought it made for a properly thought out gift. As time went on and our lives became increasingly more busy, we slowly stopped using the pasta maker, and opted for faster, more convenient options for starch (we like rice) leaving our pasta maker untouched for weeks at a time.

This past weekend, inspired by a MasterChef episode and feeling bad for my untouched pasta maker, I decided to attempt a different type of pasta, fettuchine's wider cousin, [pappardelle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/06IDdD75jqA). 

I began by making the dough, just as I always have.
