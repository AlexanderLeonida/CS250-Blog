# Making pasta

## Intro

A year or so back, I bought a pasta maker for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. It was only part of my gift to her, but being in the 'cooking' stage of our relationship, I thought it made for a properly thought out gift. As time went on and our lives became increasingly more busy, we slowly stopped using the pasta maker, and opted for faster, more convenient options for starch (we like rice) leaving our pasta maker untouched for weeks at a time.

This past weekend, inspired by a MasterChef episode and feeling bad for my untouched pasta maker, I decided to attempt a different type of pasta, fettuchine's wider cousin, [pappardelle](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/06IDdD75jqA). 

## Making the Dough

I began by making the dough, just as I always have. For every one egg (depending on size), slowly add around 4/5ths of a cup of flour. When the dough is just coming together, I knead until I lose patience. Kneading the slighlty wet dough, works air into the dough, and develops gluten, making the dough more elastic over time. While it might seem like the dough may need more flour, by adding too much flour too early, you risk over flouring the dough, rendering it extremely difficult (pretty much impossible) to manage. 

If I wanted to make a slightly richer, more golden color of a dough, I would replace the one egg for ~3 egg yolks, removing the whites. 

Once the dough is complete, I wrap it in saran wrap, and put it in my refigerator for somewhere near 45 minutes. 

## Making the Pasta 

Once the 45 minutes are up, I portion my dough into smaller, more manageable pieces, and begin to roll them out in my pasta maker. Starting at the widest setting, I slowly increase the number of the rolling machine, flattening the pasta sheet over time. As I continue to roll the pasta sheet out, I will add flour to my sheet so that it doesn't stick to my pasta maker, the counter, or to itself. While holding the pasta, I always use the backs of my hands in order to maintain the structure of the sheet as to not accidentally rip a hole in it. 

Once I have my very long pasta sheet, I lightly flour the counter top that I'll be using, lightly flour both sides of my sheet of pasta, and roll it up from both side towards the center. Then, using a bench scraper, I cut them up, unfold, and I have my pasta sheets. 

If this made no sense, see the video linked above.
