## Nick's Kitchen

This is interesting to me because I'm interested in the process of making food. I really love to eat good food, and I think that both the output of me making my own food, and the process of making that food has always been fun for me. 

The data in this narrative is a. the set of ingredients used to make this recipie, and b. the set of instructive steps used in the recipie. 

The form / interface of this information impacts the narrative in a positive way. Things like the quality of camera, the way Nick dresses, the cookware that he uses, or even the decorations in the background show that this is a professional video that should be taken seriously. Personally, identifying everything on my screen from this video as "high quality", I am both inspired, and intruiged at a distinct form of artistry that can't currently be obtained in my own kitchen. 

I think that this would not be better in a different form, I feel like the colorful visuals are important. I also think that visually seeing what the food looks like as it's being decsribed is important in order to attempt to replicate by myself in the future. 

If Nick Digiovanni were to re-tell this narrative today, I'd want him to do it in the exact same way. If I could choose, I'd have him do it right in front of me so that I could also smell what was happening. For me personally, touch is not important for learning.
