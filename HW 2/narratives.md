# Narratives

## [Nick's Kitchen - Lasagna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Q-zzCgCwY)

This is interesting to me because I'm interested in the process of making food. I really love to eat good food, and I think that both the output of me making my own food, and the process of making that food has always been fun for me. 

The data in this narrative is a. the set of ingredients used to make this recipie, and b. the set of instructive steps used in the recipie. 

The form / interface of this information impacts the narrative in a positive way. Things like the quality of camera, the way Nick dresses, the cookware that he uses, or even the decorations in the background show that this is a professional video that should be taken seriously. Personally, identifying everything on my screen from this video as "high quality", I am both inspired, and intruiged at a distinct form of artistry that can't currently be obtained in my own kitchen. 

I think that this would not be better in a different form, I feel like the colorful visuals are important. I also think that visually seeing what the food looks like as it's being decsribed is important in order to attempt to replicate by myself in the future. 

If Nick Digiovanni were to re-tell this narrative today, I'd want him to do it in the exact same way. If I could choose, I'd have him do it right in front of me so that I could also smell what was happening. For me personally, touch is not important for learning. 

## [Ray Chen - Sibelius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-unvYedx8&list=RD3u-unvYedx8&start_radio=1&pp=oAcB)

This is interesting to me because I'm interested in both classical music, and by those talented enough to perform it. I've always been interested in 'good' music, and really enjoy hearing different interpretations of pieces by people who far more talented than myself. It's always incredible to see what others can do that I can't. I think that crossing the line of not knowing enough to know what you don't know to knowing enough to realize how much you don't know is always the most interesting part of entertaining any hobby. 

The data in this narrative is the audio, music. There could also be the argument of the visuals of this video, which I agree with, but I think that I would get an extremely similar experience listening to this video without audio. 

The form / interface of this information impacts the narrative in a positive way, where by being able to listent to this video on Youtube, I'm able to both 1. Rewind the video to wherever, whenever I want, and 2. Adjust the volume at a tap, all from the comfort of my own bed. Growing up watching Operas, or listening to concertos / plays, the worst part of the experience for me was always sitting stiff and still for hours on end. While watching video on youtube, if I need to use the bathroom while listening, I can. In an opera house or auditorium, not a chance. 

I think that there are many ways that this data could be presented better in a different form. With this being said, I don't think that the technology to make this possible exists yet. Although listening from the comfort of my own home is great, I still do take time out of my days to attend as many live music sessions as posible because the audio that I hear from a laptop isn't yet of the same quality as when I hear somebody else perform live. If the quality of the audio could be the same, I think that there'd be a much harder argument for me to ever return live to a performance. 

## [A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews](https://academyflex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-practical-guide-to-quantitative-finance-interviews.pdf)

This is interesting to me because of the way that the book is written. I was originally interested in quantitative finance, because although I know that I'm not smart enough to enter such a highly competetive field, I do think that taking a look in from the outside can sometimes be interesting. This book is by far, one of the most interesting books I've ever read, and it combines a lot of logical thinking, statistics, combinatoric, and linear algebra in order to solve questions that one might find themselves in every day life. I find this book to be one of the most applicable books for logical, algorithmic, math focused thinkers, who others generally classify as "smart". 

The data in this narrative are the words, sectioned into problems. Each question / problem is one that might be asked within an actual quantitative finance interview, and is known to be the overarching Bible of all quant firms. 

THe form of this information impacts the narrative in a purposeful way. Books are read at a slower pace than a video is usually watched. The words that are read on this book (even if virtually), will take longer to process than if someone were to narrate the book with pictures and images in order to keep your attention as long as possible. Books, unlike videos, I believe, assume that you chose it with a purpose. You've chosen this book, and want to read it for some particular reason. This is why some books choose to start off slow, because they believe that capturing the interest of the reader isn't important, maintaining it is. With the internet being available to everyone in such a way that it basically promotes short term attention spans, videos believe that capturing the interest of the reader is what's most important. By presenting this information in the form of a book, you require the reader to slow down and really understand what it is that's being read. This, I believe, helps with learning. 

I don't believe that there is a better way to present this information, except by instead of pdf, a physical book (its original form). I think that the questions in this book are structured and purposeful, I think that the quality of the questions are extremely solid, and I find the authors tone to be almost mesmorizing, almost as if a spell was being cast on me, telling me, "this book isn't for certain people, it's for everyone. understand it and become a better, smarter person". 

Yes, I think such a spell might be extremely dangerous for a myriad of reasons, but, nonetheless, I still think its' contents are interesting
