# Tasteless Soups

## Am I getting old

I just erased a couple of paragraphs of writing of which would have been in the place of this current blog. I removed those words because I found myself stuck, pausing on a claim that I didn't truly believe in. As I continue to get older, I'm finding that I'm quickly becoming slower and slower in the processing of my own thoughts. 

When I was young and passionate about everything, it felt as though I'd be able to hold an intellectually stimulating conversation with anyone about anything, regardless of age. Someone would bring up a topic or idea, and interesting thoughts would funnel and flood through my mind as if a dam had ripped open towards endless curiousity and imaginativity. This is no longer the case. 

Almost as if I've become stupider, slower, and am deteriorating with age (I'm still only 21), I no longer find myself filled with sparks of quick, creative thought. And I don't know why. Unfortunately, this is not a case of, "I'm so old and wise now that I explore differing opinions on my own!". With time and careful thought, I'm sure that I could. This is not the case for me. 

## Mind reading

I now, more often find myself void of thought, or care, towards what others say to me. It's almost as if I can read other's minds and can predict what will be said. Then, I begin to lose focus and interest in the current topic at hand. 

It feels as though in any conversation, the other person involved is either uninterested and answers as shallowly as possible, or only says what they think I might guess that they'll say. Most conversations now, feel like either an extremely slow conversation with myself, or like I'm speaking to an NPC. 

If the conversation between two people is a massive pot of soup, even if I'm the one constantly stirring, even if I'm the one throwing in different spices and ingredients, attepmting to pull something out from the other person, it feels as though they're only ever throwing in more salt. Even more so, it feels like some people pretend to throw in salt but really, they're throwing in nothing.

It's at this time that I must acknowledge that I hope I'm not so ignorant to disregard why this might be the case. Maybe it's because the people I speak to aren't close to me. Maybe they don't feel comfortable around me, and maybe more importantly, I make them feel uncomforatble somehow. Maybe it seems as though I'm judging others when they speak to me which leads to others not wanting to open up. It could even be because of the people that I choose to speak to in the first place, which would fall again, on the fault of myself.

I think my curiousity lies in whether these questions are valid for a majority of the conversations that I have. Because if not, what else is happening to me? Why do conversations feel so stale? 

## Coping with what matters

The next problem I'm facing is the question of whether or not the content of these conversations matter.

If, for example, I'm talking to somebody about what their definition of success might look like, then, does what they say matter to me? Why does it matter? Will there be an answer that I haven't heard of before? Will there be a proposed revolutionary argument from somebody who rarely thinks about these sorts of thoughts? Probably not. 

If I am in fact looking for these subtantial thoughts, maybe the only surefire place to find them will be in scholarly literature, where people have dedicated massive portions of their life into answering the questions that I have. 

Even still, I, as I believe most humans do, crave human connection. I fear that if I were to dive into these rabbit holes alone, I'd end up further removed from the general populace than I already feel that I am. Either that, or I'll end up smart enough to convince others to engage in compelling conversations with me.

## An inconclusive conclusion

Where do these thoughts leave me? I'm unsure where to start, or if it's even worth starting. Maybe countless others feel like me, and this is the way 'growing up' is supposed to feel. I often associate growing up with loneliness, and if this is what's implied, I hope that I'm wrong.
